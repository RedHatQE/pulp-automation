# Pulp Automation Invetory File
# =============================
#
# About
# -----
# Pulp automation is a suite of test cases that examine REST API functionality of Pulp.
# A bunch of test cases that verify E2E scenarios with both real and mocked Pulp consumers
# is included. This file provides pulp automation with information necessary to run the
# test cases.
#
# The Pulp Role
# -------------
# describes REST API endpoint the test cases should use:
# - auth: [username, password] for the https REST client
# - url:  the protocol&hots part of the pulp URL
# - hostname: FQDN of the machine running pulp service
# - verify_api_ssl: Enables ssl verification via api. So just provide here path to the
#           trusted CA situated on the laptop in case you'd like to enable it
#           (you should copy the cert form pulp).
#           False - disables ssl.
#
#
# The Qpid Role
# -------------
# describes the RMI Broker endbpoint of Pulp for mocked consumer to attach to
# - url: the amqp url of the broker
#
# The Repos Role
# lists various repositories to be used during testing. Test cases apply filter
# criteria on the list to select best repos for testing based on repo attributes:
# - id: mandatory ID field to use in Pulp when referring to the repo
# - type: (importer) type ID to distinguish various repo kinds
# - feed: data source of the repo; the URL
# - display_name: to show in Pulp
# - tags: a list of custom repo "descriptors"
#
# The Consumers Role
# ------------------
# lists consumers to run real Pulp Consumer Client suite on
# Test cases apply filter criteria on the list to select best consumers
# for testing based on consumer attributes:
# - id: mandatory ID field to use in Pulp when referring to the repo
# - hostname: for automation commands execution over ssh
# - ssh_key: for automation commands execution over ssh; root access
# - verify: True or False (enables/disables ssl). This field can also be left empty
#           then no changes will be done to the consumer conf file and default/current settings
#           will be used(for examle the one that were specified in the installation script)
#           Right now the ssl is enabled by default.
# - ca_path: path to the ca cert on the consumer in case verify is True.
#            (this field can be used, for example, in case of testing with wrong/none cert)
# - os
#   - name: of the operating system
#   - version: of the operating system
# - repos: a list of repo pointers or repos to bind the consumer to
# - tags: a list of custom consumer "descriptors"
#
#
# The Nodes Role
# lists nodes to test
# attributes:
# - auth: the auth details to log into pulp running on the node
# - id: unique pulp node id
# - hostname: as above
# - ssh_key: as above
# - url: the url of pulp server running on the node
# - verify_api_ssl: as in pulp section
# - display_name: shown to users instead of id
# - description: some details about the node
# - tags: as above, for test case filtering
# - pulp: the link to the pulp (parent) node
# - qpid: the link to the parent node broker; the child node talks
#         consumer language over there with its parent
# - ca_path: as with pulp
# Please, note that for the Node tests to work the OAuth should be configured
# See the Pulp docs for more details
#
#
# The Proxy Role
# use proxy where applicable, esp. with repos
# attributes:
# - hostname: mandatory; protocol+hostname specification, see https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1032
# - port: mandatory; Squid: 3128
# - username: optional
# - password: mandatory if username specified
