Pulp-Automation
===============

Some pulp API/CLI testing automation

Contents:
---------
/deploy - thereis an ~~ansible and~~ ec2 pulp deployment
ansible deployment (temporarily) moved to https://github.com/peterlacko/pulp-automation-ci


/tests  - pulp api/cli testcases

/pulp_auto - our library


Requirements for running:
-------------------------

Please make sure that before running setup.py you have `python2.7, python-devel, m2crypto and gcc installed`!

    python ./setup.py install


Basic usage:
------------

To run tests:

* `cd pulp-automation; cp tests/inventory.yaml ./` and update the template as needed (visit the file for instructions)
* To run all tests:

        nosetests -vs
    
* To run a particular test:

        nosetests -vs tests/test_1_login.py

All testcases should pass. If something fails it means that:
* there is a regression bug,
* some bugs are on_qa state and expected failure decorator(used to mark automated BZ tests as pass) should be removed,
* there is a problem in the framework


To do test coverage:
--------------------
* set up [remote python tracing](https://github.com/RedHatQE/python-moncov)
* run test cases while collecting coverage records
* visit  `.coveragerc`
* [generate coverage stats](https://github.com/RedHatQE/python-moncov/wiki/coverage-with-python-files-over-sshfs) 

Docker usage
------------
To run, set the env variable `PULPHOST` to override packaged `inventory.yaml` entries:
`docker run -it -e PULPHOST=pulp.example.com redhatqe/pulp-automation:latest`
The default pulp hostname used in the inventory is `pulp.example.com`
Setting up hostnames resolution should also make the tests run.

The pulp-automation image uses a volume--workdir to run nosetest in.
You can find the test results in the workdir counterpart on your docker host, such as:
`/mnt/sda1/var/lib/docker/vfs/dir/<container ID>/`
Having run the container, you should find e.g. `nosetests.xml` inside, which you could feed to your `Jenkins` server.

The pulp-automation image repo is hosted on the [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/redhatqe/pulp-automation/)
