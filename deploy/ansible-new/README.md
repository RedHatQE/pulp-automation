## Pulp-automation deployment using ansible
* each deployment (specified by automation_name, including bucket) should be used for testing of single pulp version (ie. do not mix 2.7-testing with 2.7-devel) where different testing scenarios run from single automation node.
* ansible is idempotent, thus new nodes won't be deployed if node with given name already exists
* do not use dash '-' in name of nodes (including automation_name), use underscore instead
* as testing nodes are currently supported Fedora 20, 22, RedHat 7.1, as automation runner and reposerver Fedora only

Following test scenarios are currently supported:
    * single-node: everything is running on single node. Upon each run pulp and pulp automation is updated to newest version and tests are running. This is simplest deployment, run it first.

### Usage
* copy templates of config files from temp/ directory to ansible/ dir
* export your credentials, config path and set variables in cofig files (see below)
    * `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_access_key>`
    * `export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_secret_access_key>`
    * `export ANSIBLE_SSH_CONTROL_PATH='%(directory)s/%%h-%%r'`
* copy your own private key to ./keys/ or generate new keypair using keypair-gen: 
    * `ansible-playbook keypair-gen.yml -e @global_vars.yml`
* create security groups for simple access and pulp (vars ssh_sg and pulp_sg)
    * `ansible-playbook security-groups-create.yml -e @global_vars.yml`

#### S3 repositories deploy, config & run
Setup node for building pulp rpms and create & configure S3 bucket as a pulp repo
run:
    * `ansible-playbook -i ec2.py reposerver-deploy.yml -e @global_vars.yml`
    * `ansible-playbook -i ec2.py reposerver-run.yml -e @global_vars.yml`
* file link.txt contains link to currently built documentation (http://s3-region-name.amazonaws.com/bucket_name/current/docs/index.html) and also link to repo file

#### Automation runner deploy and configure
Setup node from which automation is running
run:
    * `ansible-playbook -i ec2.py automation-runner-deploy.yml -e @global_vars.yml`
    * `ansible-playbook -i ec2.py automation-runner-configure.yml -e @global_vars.yml`

#### Setup servers for testing scenarios contained in test-cases directory nad run automation on them
One automation-runner server is used for all scenarios. Which testing scenarios will run is specified in global_vars.yml file
run
    * `ansible-playbook -i ec2.py automation-deploy.yml -e @global_vars.yml`
    * `ansible-playbook -i ec2.py automation-configure.yml -e @global_vars.yml`
    * `ansible-playbook -i ec2.py automation-run.yml -e @global_vars.yml`



#### Terminate selected instances
if needed, terminate instance(s) with (s3 bucket will not be deleted)
    * `ansible-playbook -i ec2.py ec2-terminate-all.yml -e @global_vars.yml`

### Config files
* ansible.cfg -- main ansible config file
* ec2.ini -- ansible dynamic inventory config file
* global_vars.yml -- global variables for use in all playbooks/roles

### Playbooks
* keypair-gen -- generate new keypair for use in automation, saved to ./keys/
* security-gropus-create -- create security gropus 'ssh' and 'pulp'
* reposerver -- deploys and configures machine for building pulp (+plugins) rpms from github and uploads them to repository on s3 bucket
* automation-runner-configure/deploy -- setup and creates nod for running automation
* automation-deploy/configure/run -- deploys, configure and runs all test scenarios enabled in config file
* ec2-terminate-all -- serves for terminating specified instances
